## The web scraper for Wish Lily

Wondering how I provide Etsy, Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart, and Target search results and products without breaking a sweat? A web scraper! (duh)

This web scraper is written in Deno because they've got a free hosting service that runs on the edge, so it's really easy to have it running our API.

The API is not necessarily public nor documented, but I won't stop you from using it if you really want to (See LICENSE.md)

Anyways, if you do end up borrowing/stealing my code, **please consider giving my app a look** at [wishlily.app](https://wishlily.app/?utm_source=MathildaDocs)
